## popEye

popEye is an integrated environment to analyze eye-tracking data from reading experiments. Its unique feature is that it allows to analyze data from different experimental paradigms (single sentence reading, boundary paradigm, fast priming paradigm, text reading), collected using different eye tracking devices (SR research, tobii, etc.) and software packages (EyeTrack, Experiment Builder, etc.) within the same workflow.

Please feel free to use, test, or contribute to the package. Any help is really appreciated! The package is experimental at present, so please be patient if you encounter problems when you use popEye for the first time. Please feel free to contact me (sascha2schroeder@gmail.com) or to open an an issue on the project's github site.


## When popEye will work
